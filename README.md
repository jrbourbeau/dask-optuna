## Example

```python
import optuna
import dask.distributed
import dask_optuna

def objective(trial):
    x = trial.suggest_uniform("x", -10, 10)
    return (x - 2) ** 2

with dask.distributed.Client() as client:
    # Create a study using Dask-compatible storage
    study = optuna.create_study(storage=dask_optuna.DaskStorage())
    # Optimize in parallel on your Dask cluster
    dask_optuna.optimize(study, objective, n_trials=100)
    print(f"best_params = {study.best_params}")
```
